Welcome to Plan's documentation.  This documentation is mainly divided into
two parts.  You can get started with :ref:`installation` and then have a look
at :ref:`quickstart` in order to have a feel about how plan looks like.  You
can head over to :ref:`tutorial` if you want to know how to use Plan in real
life.  The rest part of the user's guide is about how to define one specific
job or plan object and how to run one plan object so that it talks with your
crontab process.  If you are interested in the internals of Plan, go to the
:ref:`api` documentation.
