Python 3 Support
================

Plan and all of its dependencies support Python 3 so you can start managing
your cron jobs in Python 3 Now.  Though, Python 3 currently has very few users
and a lot PyPI provided libraries do not support Python 3 yet.  If you are a
beginner, unless you are aware of what you are doing, I recommend using Python
2.x until the whole ecosystem is ready.


Requirements
------------

If you want to use Plan with Python 3 you need to use Python 3.3 or higher.
Older versions are *not* going to be supported.
